  <h1>Reporting a Vulnerability</h1>
</div>

Security is *really* important to me. Unfortunately, I'm... not exactly what you'd call a professional developer, so I'm probably gonna mess something up while building this app.

If you find something, please let me know ASAP so I can try to fix it as soon as I can. You can [report vulnerabilities right here on GitHub](https://github.com/JackDotJS/node-studio/security/advisories), or alternatively, you can add me on Discord. That said, I don't like having my Discord username publicly visible because of spam bots, so you can find me via my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/s5nQBxFPp2). Thanks for understanding.
